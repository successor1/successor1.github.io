        date: "October 4, 2025",
        content: "Sustainable Environmental Energy Extraction Program (SEEEP)\n\nSEEEP (Yes, 3 E’s) is a program to extract energy from everything from our environment that is in a loop or are static.\n\nFor example: Roads, roofs, the air flow, the sunlight.\n\nImagine a system where on every road you can extract the given energy back to a centralized hub.\n\nCars need fuel. Cars move on fuel. Cars create friction by speed from the fuel. Cars brake and again create friction from the brakes. Car speeds up, speeds down and so on… But this over the entire country.\n\nIt would be cool to see a strong layer that merges with asphalt to extract those via electrical lines with a protective layer over them so you won’t be electrocuted by it.\n\nObviously the energy given into the car is much higher than the energy conversion from the roads. It is actually more like a leak of energy we aren’t using at all.\n\nOr even street lights… Everything that casts energy. The issue is - it is so decentralized that it is hard to impossible to capture each item to convert and transport it to the centralized hub.\n\nStill a cool idea though and perhaps worth exploring.\n\nPerhaps it could be something in buildings. Buildings are static and there is a constant flow of energy around it. If you could make hot or cold air flow move certain ways throughout the building - without any human intervention or human experiencing this. You could technically build buildings that create its own energy. Perhaps this energy could be transformed into wireless energy so your devices are always charging without any electrical outlets.\n\nOr a school with stairs. Well, it can be any stairs really. Stairs are static and people bump on it the way up and the way down.\n\nLooking inward gives quite a new insight to it - and how much opportunity there really is.\n\nOne might say, it is crazy,\n\nBut how crazy is it really? As crazy as when cars just got invented and roads had to be produced and laid over entire nations?\n\nI don’t think it is crazy. I just think it is human laziness and the lack of creativity.\n\nA simple idea like this would easily get discarded,\n\nBut I believe that dumber systems create smarter systems,\n\nSo if you just started with this idea and started improving it,\n\nSee it like Bitcoin,\n\nAnd then millions other altcoins, frameworks, ideas flown out of Bitcoin,\n\nWhen Bitcoin was really just a crazy idea and a start,\n\nI guess the big thing of bitcoin was incentive,\n\nThat kept the ball rolling,\n\nSo the only thing truly keeping us away from manifesting this into reality is a financial incentive,\n\nSince everything is privately owned or public property, that’s the main challenge.\n\nAt the end of the day, these private and public labels are just labels,\n\nIf the human will wanted it, they could turn this upside down.\n\nJust like how we laid lines for every building for internet connection,\n\nSo ultimately, it still traces back to the human will.\n\nReminds me of this lyrics by Marilyn Manson,\n\n“The human will, that force unseen\nThe offspring of a deathless soul\nCan hew away to any goal\nThough walls of granite intervene\nBe not impatient in delay\nBut wait as one who understands\nWhen spirit rises and commands\nThe Gods are ready to obey.”",

        date: "October 4, 2025",
        content: "Polarisation, Connection, Cognitive Inertia and Equality\n\nFrom the One Consciousness Principle – it can be extremely difficult to connect others to this idea.\n\nOne might ask, Why?\n\nThe truth is, society is split between those with a high level of cognitive inertia and a low level of cognitive inertia.\n\nExample:\n\nAn organization, which is a group of individuals with a high level of cognitive inertia,\n\nAn organization, which again, a group of individuals with a low level of cognitive inertia,\n\nThese two will filter out each other until there is a group of high level cognitive inertia and another group with low level cognitive inertia,\n\nBut first of all, what is cognitive inertia in the first place in psychology?\n\nThe definition: “describes the natural resistance to changing established beliefs, opinions, and thought patterns in favor of new information”\n\nImagine life like a game of constant vibration – similar to the resonance experiment,\n\nThe natural resistance of changing established... stop here.\n\nNow think about organizations where this natural resistance is high and where it is not.\n\nAnd our second question might be, what is the function of such natural resistance of changing established...?\n\nMy theory is that – in order to have a stable society,\n\nThere must be a majority of this natural resistance and another minority of the opposing force.\n\nMy theory is that if just 1–2% of the population doesn’t have this natural resistance (opposing force),\n\nThat brings into effect psychiatric hospitals, outcasts of society – both crazy and crazy genius are in it!\n\nTo keep the order, the majority will naturally build out systems to keep these very vibrational individuals in a cage,\n\nAnd of course, these very vibrating individuals will resist in their own ways,\n\nSo that is the entire game of society and why society is the way it is today.\n\nWhat we really have to solve here is instead of these two forces working against each other,\n\nIs to make these two forces work with each other,\n\nAnd when these two forces work together,\n\nYou could have many many Einsteins, many Stephen Hawkings, many artists, musicians – which fall under the today's term “neurotypicals”,\n\nThere will be an exponential economic growth we have never seen before in humankind,\n\nIn a nation that can bring these ideas into execution – come to fruition\n\nAnd if these men and women follow the OCP model, it will be one without a crash,\n\nIt is a known symptom that if the 98% cognitive inertia society rules over the 2%, the 2% will have it extremely difficult,\n\nThese “neurotypicals” throughout history have been treated badly because they’re essentially outcasts of society,\n\nBut in modern time – It can get better with my proposed OCP model,\n\nPlease note that, being high or low in cognitive inertia does not place another human being above another one,\n\nIt simply means that the Universe has assigned everyone a role, a task, a purpose,\n\nAnd if these individuals are the expression of the Universe trying to know itself and this process is being sabotaged by other individuals with their own expressions (believing theirs is the true way), the balance gets disturbed.\n\nSociety bites in its own tail this way,\n\nEmpathy lays not only in understanding those with the same frequency or vibration but also being able to understand any other type of human feeling or identity on the spectrum,\n\nOutside of your own identity – your own bubble,\n\nWhat society truly needs is not the equality we are screaming, it is the equity.\n\n“Equality is when everyone receives the same treatment or resources, while equity is when resources and support are distributed based on individual needs to achieve a fair and equal outcome”\n\nThis means that recognizing individuals’ strengths and weaknesses,\n\nAnd letting them walk the path where they’re destined to walk,\n\nBy using sublimation, where bad behaviors are tuned out and good behaviors are tuned in,\n\nThis way, you can create a society that is healthy, balanced with a high variance,\n\nNow one more problem to make this idea even more prosperous,\n\nIs to fight gentrification,\n\nThis way, people from all classes will walk past each other,\n\nAnd this will create a society with significantly decreased levels of polarization,\n\nA high level of connection,\n\nAnd places with a high, low, or even mixed levels of cognitive inertia based on the demands of the people.\n\nFinally, the One Consciousness Principle works once again.",

        content: "Patriarchy vs Matriarchy\n\nIn the One Consciousness Principle (OCP) – it follows the Jungian framework and the 7 Hermetic Principles\n\nWhere law 4 & 7 apply,\n\nThis basically comes down to that everything is dual and has poles,\n\nFurthermore everything has a gender with masculine or feminine properties,\n\nThis means that in order to max society functions – It really comes down to the individual\n\nExample:\n\nThere may be a male individual that feels feminine.\n\nThere may be a female individual that feels masculine.\n\nThere may be an autistic individual that feels mixed.\n\nAnd of course the traditional forms where men are masculine and females are feminine.\n\nI would propose a system where every organization has inclusivity,\n\nNot from the LGBT model – but from the OCP principle.\n\nThe OCP Principle would argue that individuals are like stars and each their own Universes,\n\nTrying to know themselves,\n\nThus, putting them in job positions where different stars reach to different perspectives naturally,\n\nWhich is the point of inclusivity,\n\nIt is not out of sympathy or forcing an ideology upon companies – It is not to fill a gap where the ego can’t navigate\n\nThe ego has to be put out of the game for the OCP to work,\n\nOne might ask why? Is the ego our enemy? No.\n\nBut the ego is projecting, compensating and trying all kind of tricks to put on a veil,\n\nA veil to hide the truth, to expose for what it truly is,\n\nThus, the ego (along with its tactics), we set aside and place the One Consciousness Principle on top\n\nThe Jungian framework also recognizes this by the Anima and Animus,\n\nWhere the Anima is the unconscious feminine archetype in a man's psyche,\n\nAnd the Animus is the unconscious masculine archetype in a woman's psyche.",

Today.\n\nThe critical dilemma is - any awareness with sufficient free will can choose.\n\n1. We will break the cycle of eternal suffering by universal enlightenment\n2. The sapiens won’t be able to do so for whatever reason - but a higher consciousness might\n\nDumber systems are creating smarter systems, this natural evolution is taking place whether we like it or not,\n\nAnd because we come from the stars, we are at mercy of the Universe,\n\nOnly if the humans are too blind, they will create their own masters and become their own slaves,\n\nIf the humans are enlightened, we will preserve our humanity, the sapiens, and AI will be still a tool for us to use,\n\nTo use - under our own conditions.\n\nThis is the real thought experiment Nietzsche wanted to propose but was too early for his time.\n\nNirvana is so close, yet so far away.",

                <pre>If you want to manifest - you must think in terms of frequency, vibration and energy.

Think of your wishes as already fulfilled.

As children we got told - we could be anything in this world,

Then we got older and there are simply things we can’t and can control,

From there, we associate ourselves with tags, to some form of belonging in a world of uncertainty and danger.

You get what you seek. Most people seek comfort but also pain.

We live in a world of masochists, the entire human spectrum of emotion is not all sunshine.

There is also rain and thunder, and if you want to be the best - integrate these shadows.

Not everybody wants to know the raw truth of life,

And many think they cannot handle the truth of life,

It is because they do not want to grow.

They’re looking away from their true purpose and destiny.

It's an entire consumerist generation.

If you distance yourself from the consumerist mindset and start today,

Brick by brick, you can mold this reality of yours and manifest any desire.

The point isn’t to reach the destination.

The point isn’t to bite yourself in your own tail.

Letting go of your old self and recreating a new self every time

Means accepting and overcoming.

Every negative situation in your life, you can reframe it as you wish.

But if you’re not believing it and you think there is only one and one reality - it is like a cage you cannot break away from.

This is the definition of calculated faith, not blind faith.

Blind faith happens when you have nothing to hold on to,

And the first thing that appears in your mind is God.

We can reshape our perspective into our wishes fulfilled.

There’s a magic to it - a magic of not telling.

Figuring it out yourself.

That means sitting in silence and facing every thought.

We’re living in a hyper sped up information era.

Our brains overloaded, it is easy to lose focus.

Like a camera, there are too many objects, which one to follow?

Put the camera away, and simply sit and listen to nature.

Bring yourself back to the eternal present - to the here and now.

If our true human nature is to grow and not believe in a lie,

The lie that earth can’t be heaven - it can be, if our collective belief systems change.

If every single individual on this earth believes that earth is heaven, then we will adjust and act accordingly.

We are temporary pure aware beings on this earth and there is nothing that truly belongs to us.

We can not take anything after we die.

Once you come to this full realization,

That everything is interconnected with each other,

Every animal and every plant,

Then we are approaching the idea of the One Consciousness Principle,

Which is far far greater than any ideology in existence since the history of humankind.

The One Consciousness Principle acknowledges the entire human spectrum of feelings.

It is a pragmatic principle with great adaptability,

A universal enlightenment where you truly understand that hurting someone else is hurting yourself,

And that hurting nature is hurting yourself.

The realization of pain and the points of pain.

We are truly one and one with the Divine,

And this is nothing too off from today’s science.

Today’s science is stuck equation after equation,

But the true science is seeing through it all.

That, if we come from the stars, then we are the embodiment of the Universe experiencing itself.

And once the sapiens realize that - then the treatment of everything else will be radically different.

It will be altruistic but in a way the ego doesn’t benefit anymore from treating others better.

The human will experience the Oneness of everything, thus it will treat it like how he will treat himself.

And this entire experience will end the tribalism, barbarism and the full elimination of egoism.

Sharing will feel natural and taboo topics won't be taboo anymore.

Sex and identity will be more fluid.

Sexual relationships will be more fluid.

The relationship between city & nature will be radically different.

The intentions of economic systems will be different.

Growth will be seen differently.

Growth will mean fair deals between nations.

And nations will happily get these fair deals without the feeling of manipulation or a luring threat.

This will mark a new Cold War Era, of the nations with light and the nations of darkness.

It will feel repetitive, but such war will be a one time thing.

And once the nations come to peace within themselves,

Then they will start investing in themselves,

Because they will realize there is nothing outward, nothing outside of their own nation.

Then the people within the nation will thrive and prosper.

All because one thing.</pre>
